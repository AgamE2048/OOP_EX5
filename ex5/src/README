*********** Explanations on UML Diagrams ***********
As cited in ex'5 pdf, we built 2 UML diagrams. The first one represent our design before we started to write
the code of ex'5 (just after we read the pdf that was given to us).
The second one we built while we wrote the code of Ex'5, while we were writing the code, we changed a lot in
our design, added new classes for tree trunk, factory for the layers, class for the tree top, class for the
leaves and even a functional interface to get the height of the ground from trees.

A note about the leaf, TreeTop, Tree and Trunk classes: A treeTop create many objects of leaves which has
their own behaviour (the one that cited in the ex'5 pdf), and the Tree class creates objects of TreeTop and
Trunk for one tree at a time. so we can see that there is an object composition between classes (which also
can be seen in the UML diagram).

More over, we have a class that generates the perlin noise to the ground and the terrain class, we have here
also composition between classes, the terrain has an object of noise that it's contains.

The Avatar and leaves classes inherits from GameObject class, and the pepseGameManager inherits from
GameManager.

We also many more private methods to the different classes, in order to change the code to a modular code
which can be read easily.
