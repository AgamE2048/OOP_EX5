 We implemented the infinite world with a base of a finite world. Every time our character [we chose a flying
 pig -- more explanation on that later] goes to the ranges out of the screen, we create the world at the
 coordinates of the new Screen (the one that the character walks in to) and delete the objects that no-longer
 on the screen, save the place of the trees that was genererated before in order to create the pseudo-random
 behavoiur.

*********** EXPLANATION ON PLANTING TREES ***********

In this section, we will exspain on the planting trees algorithm.

First, we have some classes that responsible for creating trees. We have the Leaf- that is responsible for
the leaf behaviour (inclding the transition of the leaves and the recreation of the leaves).
We also have a TreeTop class that resposible of creating the leaves of the tree itself, a Trunk
class that responsible to create the trunk of the trees - which made of block, and the Tree class
which is responsible to create all the parts of the tree itself., which get the ground height via
a functional interface that terrain is implementing.

A note on behaviour of leaves. In order to create the desired functionality of leaves creating on the tree and
recreate, we create 2 scheduled tasks that responsible to this functionality, we also create transitions to make
leaves see that they fall in the wind, change size and use the faseOut method to create the functionality of
faded leaves (more exsplanatio in the code of ex'5).

*********** DESIGN ISSUES ***********

In this section, we will talk about the design issues that went while we written the ex5 code.
First,we had a problem that the Terrain andthe Trees use the Block class (as written in the pdf that
it is a bad programming). So we added a functional interface with the function groundHeightAtX0, that our
terrain implements.

We added a factory for the different layers for the different objects. We use it in order to add the object in
the correct layer and delete it from the correct layer.

*********** BONUS ***********

Here, we will talk about the bonus part (insert a partying emoji here).

First of all, we changed the Avater to be a flying pig! (In the gesture of  the pig from minecraft - Reuben).
It also jumps when it stands becuse it is exited to explore the world!!

More over, we thought to ourselves so... "we have a sun, so why don't we have a moon?". As you can guess,
we added a moon to the game :)

So why stop there, let's add a energy bar so te user can see what is going on with the energy of the charcter.
So... we added an energy bar.

And if we also have a leaves that fall down, we added the functionality that they change a color, into a
bscission color.

And one last thing, beware of sinkholes. You should not fall into them, else you
will get to the doom, so you must play carefully.
